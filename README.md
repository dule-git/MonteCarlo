# MonteCarlo
Monte Carlo simulation with X-Ray generator and a virtual phantom.

The project is based on Monte Carlo simulation that consists of the x-ray generator source that shoots photons.
Photons then interact with the body phantom that can have multiple phantoms in it. These inner phantoms represent organs.
Photons can be absorbed inside the body phantom.
Behind the phantom there is a detector that detects when a photon hit it.
The result is a matrix that represents an x-ray image of the body phantom.
